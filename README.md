# Bootstrapping for Unity

**Bootstrapping** is a modular initialization framework for Unity. It provides full control over both game startup and per-scene initialization, supports asynchronous logic, and intercepts Unity's default scene launching behavior for optimized memory and loading flow.

## Features
- ‚öôÔ∏è Game Boot Modules ‚Äî execute before any scene is loaded.
- üß© Scene Boot ‚Äî per-scene logic triggered automatically after scene load.
- üîÑ Intermediate Scene ‚Äî optional mechanism to fully unload memory between scenes.
- üß™ MonoBehaviour-free game boot modules ‚Äî written as plain C# classes.
- ‚úÖ Execution order ‚Äî supported via the `[GameBootOrder]` attribute.
- üñºÔ∏è Optional loading screen ‚Äî shown during scene transitions.
- üõ†Ô∏è Editor integration ‚Äî registry is auto-generated, with manual override.

## How It Works
### Game Boot Modules
Each boot module can implement one of two interfaces:
- `IBootModule` ‚Äî for synchronous logic.
- `IAsyncBootModule` ‚Äî for async logic (e.g. `await`-based initialization).

Here is an example of an async boot module:
```csharp
[GameBootOrder(10)]
public class MyBootModule : IAsyncBootModule
{
    public async Task RunAsync()
    {
        await LoadSomeData();
    }
}
```
These modules are executed **before the first scene**. Specifically, the scene defined at **Build Index 0** is loaded first, then reloaded after all game modules complete.

### Scene Boot
Each scene must have exactly **one** scene boot. You define it by inheriting from the base class:
```csharp
public class MySceneBoot : SceneBoot
{
    protected override void Run()
    {
        InitializeStuff();
        OnFinished(); // signal completion
    }
}
```

SceneBoot is executed automatically after the scene loads.  
The system will wait until `OnFinished()` is called.

## üîÉ Intermediate Scene
To ensure complete memory release between scenes, the system can insert a lightweight empty scene before loading the actual target scene.
> ‚úÖ You must create this scene manually and name it exactly:
>
> ```
> Intermediate
> ```
> ‚úÖ It must also be included in **Build Settings**.

This technique avoids memory spikes during transitions and allows safe unloading.

## Loading Screen (Optional)
You can display a loading screen during scene transitions. To do so, set the screen instance at runtime:
```csharp
LoadingScreenProvider.SetScreen(myScreen);
```

Your screen must implement the following interface:
```csharp
public class MyLoadingScreen : MonoBehaviour, ILoadingScreen
{
    public bool IsShowed { get; private set; }

    public void MarkAsDontDestroyOnLoad()
    {
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
    }

    public void Show(bool skipAnimations, Action callback)
    {
        IsShowed = true;
        // optionally play animation...
        callback?.Invoke();
    }

    public void Hide()
    {
        IsShowed = false;
        // optionally hide instantly or animate...
    }
}
```

### When to set the loading screen
You should assign the loading screen **as early as possible**, before any scene transitions occur.  
The recommended way is to create a game boot module that instantiates and sets the screen:
```csharp
[GameBootOrder(-100)]
public class LoadingScreenInstaller : IBootModule
{
    public void Run()
    {
        var prefab = Resources.Load<MyLoadingScreen>("UI/LoadingScreen");
        var instance = Object.Instantiate(prefab);
        LoadingScreenProvider.SetScreen(instance);
    }
}
```

## How to Load Scenes
To load a scene using the framework (with optional intermediate scene and loading screen), use the static method:
```csharp
StartCoroutine(SceneLoader.LoadScene("MyScene"));
```

Or, if you want to skip loading screen animations:
```csharp
StartCoroutine(SceneLoader.LoadScene("MyScene", skipShowLoadingScreenAnimations: true));
```

This will automatically handle:
- showing the loading screen (if set),
- transitioning through the intermediate scene (if applicable),
- executing scene boot logic.

## Editor Integration
Boot modules are discovered automatically after each script compilation.

You can also trigger the scan manually via:
```
Tools ‚Üí WhiteArrow ‚Üí Bootstrapping ‚Üí Update Registry
```

To enable or disable the entire boot system:
```
Tools ‚Üí WhiteArrow ‚Üí Bootstrapping ‚Üí Enable / Disable
```

## Installation
This framework is distributed as source code.  
Simply copy it into your project.  
UPM support may be added later.

## TODO (What‚Äôs Next)
Here are some ideas we‚Äôre considering to make Bootstrapping even more powerful and easy to use:
- üîß **Auto-create Intermediate scene** if it doesn‚Äôt exist yet.
- üß© **Make Intermediate scene the build index 0** ‚Äî for simpler full control without reloading.
- üîÑ **Optional intermediate scene on scene-to-scene transitions** ‚Äî not just game start.
- üñºÔ∏è **Assign loading screen via editor or config** ‚Äî no code needed.
